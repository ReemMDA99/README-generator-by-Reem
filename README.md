### What is a README?

A great README file helps your project to stand out from the sea of open-source software on GitHub. A README is like the face of your project. It is the first file a person should read when encountering a source tree, and it should be written as a very brief and giving very basic introduction to the software

### What is a README generator?

This README generator will allow the user to answer a series of specific questions and create a professional complete README based on their responses.
